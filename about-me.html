  <h1>About Me</h1>

  <p>
    My name is Elnaz, and I’m an English teacher who finds joy in helping others grow through language and communication. Teaching allows me to connect with people, share knowledge, and inspire confidence in their ability to express themselves.
  </p>
  <p>
    Beyond teaching, I’m deeply passionate about technology and self-development. My future goals include learning more languages, expanding my skills in web design, and continuing to explore how AI can empower personal growth and creativity.
